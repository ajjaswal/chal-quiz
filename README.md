## Description
   I used JavaScript to create a code quiz that tests you on different javascript elements. There is a 75 second timer that increases/decreases based on time and questions answered. The time at the end is the user's high score. This score can be saved with the user's initials using localStorage. The quiz can be replayed as the answer order is randomized and highscores can be cleared.
